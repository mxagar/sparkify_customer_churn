# Sparkify: Customer Churn Prediction of a Music Streaming Service Using Spark

This project analyzes and predicts customer churn of a music streaming service using Spark on a large dataset.

I took the starter code for this repository from a Udacity assignment project and modified it to the present form, which deviates significantly from the original form; see [`starter`](starter).

### Installing Dependencies for Custom Environments

If you'd like to control where the notebook runs, you need to create a custom environment and install the required dependencies. A quick recipe which sets everything up with [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) is the following:

```bash
# Create environment with YAML, incl. packages
conda env create -f conda.yaml
conda activate sparkify

# Or
conda create --name rec-ibm pip python=3.9
conda activate sparkify
# and install version-specific pip dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# To track any changes and versions you have
conda env export > conda.yaml
pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt
```
